# Javascript Password Generator 

## Description

Everyone needs a secure password to protect their accounts and information. This is why I developed a javascript password generator. This password generator is customizable! Once clicking on the generate password button you will be presented five customization options. These options include; password length, numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters. Once finished answering all the prompts your new password will be displayed in the textbox. If you wish to create another password, refresh the page and go through the same process described earlier again.
