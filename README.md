# JavaScript Password Generator 

## Description

Everyone needs a secure password to protect their accounts and information. This is why I developed a password generator. This generator is customizable to fit your specific needs!

## Instructions 
Click on the generate password button and you will be presented five customization options in the form of prompts. These options include password length, numbers, special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters. Once you are finished answering all the prompts your new password will be displayed in the textbox. If you wish to create another password, refresh the page and go through the same process described earlier again.
